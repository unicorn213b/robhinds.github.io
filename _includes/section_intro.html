			I'm a game dev with experience in several languages, engines, and development tools. I pursued a BS in Computer Science at DigiPen Institute of Technology and I got a lot of experience in C++ game development.<br></br>
			During my journey through college, I have developed a strong passion for bringing a better experience through my work to both users and developers alike. Iâ€™m consistently challenging myself to learn more and doing so has given me a well-rounded set of skills to bring to any team.
